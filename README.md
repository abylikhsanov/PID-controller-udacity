## Reflection

In order to choose the right coefficients (Kp,Kd,Ki), I have implemented the following procedure:
* Introduced an integer variable that counts the number of steps (number of calculated CTEs (errors)).
* Set all the coefficients to 0, at the initialisation step.
* Everytime, when the number of steps hits 200, the simulator restarts, with this following command to the socket:
```
std::string msg = "42[\"reset\",{}]";
ws.send(msg.data(),msg.length(),uWS::OpCode::TEXT);

```
* From my intuition, the Ki and Kp coefficients should be relatively small compared to the Kd. This is because overtime, Ki coefficient will be multiplied by the big sum of all errors (CTE) and therefore, even small increase in the Ki can lead to the overshoot, therefore, I did not change the Kp in the first place. Kp also gets multiplied by the error and it can overshoot too but with a smaller effect on the error compared to the Ki. Therefore, I have decided to tweak the Kd first(as this is the coefficient of the rate of change, it has the smallest effect, meaning that small increase in Kd will not lead to a dramatic effect). As all coefficients are set to 0, everytime the simulator hits 200 steps, Kd is being incremented by 1 and simulator then restarts.
* Only at step 10, I saw a big improvement in the motion, so I set Kd = 10.
* After that, I have decided to tweak the Kp value, the second smallest coefficient. This time, I was incrementing by 0.01. After several steps, I stopped at value 0.3, as I thought it is a time to tweak the final coefficient which will make the error almost equal to zero.
* The increment value for the Ki was 0.001. I did not see the drastic imrpovement in my motion but that was expected. Looking at the CTE values, I have stopped at Kp = 0.005.

So in short, that was a manual/Twiddle implementation.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
